2/28 Meeting

1. Finished Assignment #3
I transferred all my JS to script.js
Wrote JQuery code that creates a navbar using an array and for loop



2/14 Meeting

1. Updated my website a lot

2. Included a nav bar at the top

3. I have a section on the bottom where I will eventually put projects. Right now it is like a mini-resume

4. When you click on my photo, the background changes colors

Wasn't able to get JQuery loops to work so I deleted it

2/7 Meeting

You won't be able to see my profile pic on my website because it is locally hosted on my computer

1. HTML Reqs
I used lots of links, divs, paragraphs and images
I used boostrap for the profile pic so it is enclosed in a circle
The pic is locally stored on my computer so you won't be able to see it
I set the title of the page to be Aliya Petranik
I used the keywords and description meta SEO tags

2. CSS Reqs
I linked to a stylesheet called main.css
I changed the border radius of my Aliya Petranik box
Changed the background color of the top section of my page and the box with my name
I padded my profile image and the box with my name.
I imported Raleway from google fonts at the top of my stylesheet and used it as my font throughout
I have a hover animation over the box with  my name in it. It changes color when you hover over it

Bootstrap Reqs
Used the column function in bootstrap to make 3 colms with info about me
I think I used a component from carousel where my image is cropped into another circle image. This is in the profile pic at the top of the page. I'm still understanding bootstrap
